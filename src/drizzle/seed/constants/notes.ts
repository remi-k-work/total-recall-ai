    title: "Grocery List",
    content: `My grocery list for today is:
- Apples
- Bananas
- Chicken breast
- Rice
- Milk
- Eggs
- Spinach
- Tomatoes
- Bread
- Cheese

I also want to remember to buy some coffee and maybe some chocolate as a treat.
This week I’m trying to focus on healthy meals, so I plan to make salads and stir-fries using fresh vegetables. I also need ingredients for a few quick breakfast ideas like oatmeal and smoothies.
On top of that, I need some pantry staples like olive oil, salt, pepper, and some spices that have run out. Planning ahead will save me from multiple trips to the store and reduce food waste.`,

    title: "Favorite Color",
    content: `My favorite color is red.
I’ve always felt that red gives me energy and motivation. It’s vibrant, bold, and makes me feel more confident in my daily tasks.
Interestingly, when I was younger, my favorite color used to be blue. But over the years, red has grown on me. I think it resonates with my personality more as I’ve matured.
Red also appears in my home décor, clothes, and even in some of my work materials. I find that surrounding myself with red elements keeps me energized and focused.
I think I like it because it feels bold and powerful. Psychologically, red can increase attention and heart rate, and I like that subtle stimulation.`,

    title: "Jogging Routine",
    content: `I should be jogging more.
Recently, I’ve been too busy with work and haven’t exercised enough. I can feel my stamina dropping. My doctor also reminded me that cardio exercise is important for heart health, so I need to be more consistent.
My plan is to jog three times per week, even if just for 20 minutes. It doesn’t have to be a marathon — consistency is more important. I also want to track my distance and pace using a running app to monitor progress.
Jogging in the morning feels refreshing, especially when the sun is rising. I enjoy listening to music or podcasts while jogging. Sometimes, I plan routes near parks or rivers to make the experience more pleasant.
In the long term, I hope to build endurance and make jogging a habit. I might even consider signing up for a 5K run later this year as a personal goal.`,

    title: "Study Guide on Photosynthesis",
    content: `Photosynthesis is the fundamental biological process by which **green plants, algae, and some bacteria convert light energy, typically from the sun, into chemical energy**. This stored energy is in the form of **glucose**, a sugar, which the organisms use for fuel. This process is absolutely crucial for life on Earth, as it's the primary way that energy enters most food chains, and it's also responsible for producing the **oxygen** (O2) we breathe. The overall chemical equation for photosynthesis summarizes this transformation: 6CO2 + 6H2O + light energy -> C6H12O6 + 6O2. This equation shows that **carbon dioxide** (CO2) and **water** (H2O), in the presence of light, are converted into **glucose** (C6H12O6) and **oxygen** (O2). The process occurs primarily within specialized organelles called **chloroplasts** inside the cells of leaves. Within the chloroplasts, the green pigment **chlorophyll** plays a central role by absorbing the light energy that powers the reaction. Chlorophyll absorbs light most effectively in the blue and red parts of the electromagnetic spectrum, reflecting the green light, which is why most leaves appear green.
Photosynthesis is not a single reaction; rather, it's a complex sequence of two main stages: the **Light-Dependent Reactions** (or Light Reactions) and the **Light-Independent Reactions** (or Calvin Cycle). These two stages are tightly coupled, each relying on the products of the other.
The **Light-Dependent Reactions** occur in the **thylakoid membranes** within the chloroplasts. Thylakoids are flattened sacs stacked into structures called **grana**. These reactions **require light**. Light energy is captured by **photosystems** (complexes of proteins and pigments, including chlorophyll). This captured energy **excites electrons** in the chlorophyll molecules. These high-energy electrons are then passed along an **electron transport chain** (ETC).
To replace the lost electrons, **water (H2O) is split** in a process called **photolysis**. This splitting releases electrons (which replenish the chlorophyll), **protons (H+)**, and **oxygen (O2)** as a byproduct. The release of oxygen into the atmosphere is a critical outcome of this stage. As electrons move down the ETC, the energy released is used to **pump protons** (H+) into the thylakoid lumen, creating a high concentration gradient. These protons then flow back across the membrane through an enzyme called **ATP synthase**, which harnesses the energy of the flow to generate **adenosine triphosphate (ATP)**, an energy-carrying molecule. At the end of the ETC, the electrons, along with H+ ions, are used to reduce **nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate (NADP+)** into its energy-carrying, reduced form, **NADPH**. The light reactions thus produce **ATP** and **NADPH**, which are essential for driving the second stage, and O2 as a waste product.
The second stage, the **Light-Independent Reactions**, often referred to as the **Calvin Cycle** (or C3 cycle), takes place in the **stroma**, the fluid-filled space surrounding the thylakoids. Although this stage doesn't directly require light, it **depends on the ATP and NADPH** generated by the light reactions. The cycle begins when an enzyme called **RuBisCO** catalyzes the attachment of a **carbon dioxide (CO2)** molecule from the atmosphere to a five-carbon organic molecule called **RuBP (Ribulose-1,5-bisphosphate)**. This process is called **carbon fixation**, and it's the step that brings inorganic carbon into the biological system.
The unstable six-carbon compound quickly splits into two molecules of a three-carbon compound. Using the **ATP** and **NADPH** from the light reactions, these three-carbon molecules are then **reduced** and rearranged to form a three-carbon sugar, **G3P (glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate)**. This is the stage where the chemical energy is actually stored in a stable, organic molecule. For the cycle to continue, the initial molecule, **RuBP**, must be regenerated. Most of the **G3P** molecules are used, along with more **ATP**, to reform RuBP, allowing the cycle to start again and fix more CO2. Crucially, for every six molecules of G3P produced, **one molecule of G3P** exits the cycle. Two of these G3P molecules can combine outside the cycle to form a six-carbon sugar, **glucose** (C6H12O6), which is the main product used for energy, growth, and storage (e.g., as starch) by the plant. Photosynthesis is a critical process for all ecosystems, serving as the ultimate source of organic carbon and atmospheric oxygen.`,

    title: "Physics Study Guide - Kinematics",
    content: `## Key Formulas for Kinematics

Here are the core equations we need to memorize for the exam.

### 1. Constant Velocity

The simplest case: position $$x$$ as a function of time $$t$$.

$$
x(t) = x_0 + v_x t
$$

Where $$x_0$$ is the initial position and $$v_x$$ is the constant velocity.

### 2. Constant Acceleration

These are the "big five" equations.

1. **Velocity as a function of time:**

   $$
   v(t) = v_0 + at
   $$

2. **Position as a function of time:**

   $$
   x(t) = x_0 + v_0 t + \\tfrac{1}{2} a t^2
   $$

3. **Velocity as a function of position (the "timeless" equation):**

   $$
   v^2 = v_0^2 + 2a(x - x_0)
   $$

I always forget the quadratic formula, which is often needed to solve for $$t$$ in the position equation.
For any quadratic equation $$ax^2 + bx + c = 0$$, the solution is:

$$
x = \\frac{-b \\pm \\sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a}
$$

**Attendees:** Me, Sarah, David

### Agenda
1. Review last sprint's metrics
2. Plan for next sprint
3. Blockers and dependencies

### Discussion
- **Sarah:** User feedback on the new dashboard is very positive. One bug reported on the date filter (Ticket #452).
- **David:** The API performance is still a concern. The \`/api/v2/analytics\` endpoint is too slow.
- **Me:** I suggested we add caching, maybe with Redis.

### Action Items
* **[Me]** Investigate Redis implementation for the analytics endpoint.
* **[Sarah]** Triage Ticket #452 and assign to the frontend team.
* **[David]** Start profiling the database queries related to the slow endpoint.`,

    title: "Useful TypeScript Snippet",
    content: `### Type-Safe \`Object.keys\`
A helper function I keep using to get properly typed keys from an object in TypeScript, instead of just \`string[]\`.

\`\`\`typescript
function objectKeys<T extends object>(obj: T): (keyof T)[] {
  return Object.keys(obj) as (keyof T)[];
}

// Example usage:
const permissions = {
  admin: true,
  user: true,
  guest: false,
};

// 'keys' will have the type ('admin' | 'user' | 'guest')[]
const keys = objectKeys(permissions);
\`\`\`
This is way better than the default \`Object.keys(permissions)\` which just returns \`string[]\`.`,
