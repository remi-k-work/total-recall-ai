I’ve always felt that red gives me energy and motivation. It’s vibrant, bold, and makes me feel more confident in my daily tasks.
Interestingly, when I was younger, my favorite color used to be blue. But over the years, red has grown on me. I think it resonates with my personality more as I’ve matured.
Red also appears in my home décor, clothes, and even in some of my work materials. I find that surrounding myself with red elements keeps me energized and focused.
I think I like it because it feels bold and powerful. Psychologically, red can increase attention and heart rate, and I like that subtle stimulation.`,

Recently, I’ve been too busy with work and haven’t exercised enough. I can feel my stamina dropping. My doctor also reminded me that cardio exercise is important for heart health, so I need to be more consistent.
My plan is to jog three times per week, even if just for 20 minutes. It doesn’t have to be a marathon — consistency is more important. I also want to track my distance and pace using a running app to monitor progress.
Jogging in the morning feels refreshing, especially when the sun is rising. I enjoy listening to music or podcasts while jogging. Sometimes, I plan routes near parks or rivers to make the experience more pleasant.
In the long term, I hope to build endurance and make jogging a habit. I might even consider signing up for a 5K run later this year as a personal goal.`,

    noteTagIds: ["3b6c9d1e-8f2a-4b7c-9d5e-4a3f2b1c1007"],
    content: `Photosynthesis is the fundamental biological process by which **green plants, algae, and some bacteria convert light energy, typically from the sun, into chemical energy**. This stored energy is in the form of **glucose**, a sugar, which the organisms use for fuel. This process is absolutely crucial for life on Earth, as it's the primary way that energy enters most food chains, and it's also responsible for producing the **oxygen** (O2) we breathe. The overall chemical equation for photosynthesis summarizes this transformation: 6CO2 + 6H2O + light energy -> C6H12O6 + 6O2. This equation shows that **carbon dioxide** (CO2) and **water** (H2O), in the presence of light, are converted into **glucose** (C6H12O6) and **oxygen** (O2). The process occurs primarily within specialized organelles called **chloroplasts** inside the cells of leaves. Within the chloroplasts, the green pigment **chlorophyll** plays a central role by absorbing the light energy that powers the reaction. Chlorophyll absorbs light most effectively in the blue and red parts of the electromagnetic spectrum, reflecting the green light, which is why most leaves appear green.
Photosynthesis is not a single reaction; rather, it's a complex sequence of two main stages: the **Light-Dependent Reactions** (or Light Reactions) and the **Light-Independent Reactions** (or Calvin Cycle). These two stages are tightly coupled, each relying on the products of the other.
The **Light-Dependent Reactions** occur in the **thylakoid membranes** within the chloroplasts. Thylakoids are flattened sacs stacked into structures called **grana**. These reactions **require light**. Light energy is captured by **photosystems** (complexes of proteins and pigments, including chlorophyll). This captured energy **excites electrons** in the chlorophyll molecules. These high-energy electrons are then passed along an **electron transport chain** (ETC).
To replace the lost electrons, **water (H2O) is split** in a process called **photolysis**. This splitting releases electrons (which replenish the chlorophyll), **protons (H+)**, and **oxygen (O2)** as a byproduct. The release of oxygen into the atmosphere is a critical outcome of this stage. As electrons move down the ETC, the energy released is used to **pump protons** (H+) into the thylakoid lumen, creating a high concentration gradient. These protons then flow back across the membrane through an enzyme called **ATP synthase**, which harnesses the energy of the flow to generate **adenosine triphosphate (ATP)**, an energy-carrying molecule. At the end of the ETC, the electrons, along with H+ ions, are used to reduce **nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate (NADP+)** into its energy-carrying, reduced form, **NADPH**. The light reactions thus produce **ATP** and **NADPH**, which are essential for driving the second stage, and O2 as a waste product.
The second stage, the **Light-Independent Reactions**, often referred to as the **Calvin Cycle** (or C3 cycle), takes place in the **stroma**, the fluid-filled space surrounding the thylakoids. Although this stage doesn't directly require light, it **depends on the ATP and NADPH** generated by the light reactions. The cycle begins when an enzyme called **RuBisCO** catalyzes the attachment of a **carbon dioxide (CO2)** molecule from the atmosphere to a five-carbon organic molecule called **RuBP (Ribulose-1,5-bisphosphate)**. This process is called **carbon fixation**, and it's the step that brings inorganic carbon into the biological system.
The unstable six-carbon compound quickly splits into two molecules of a three-carbon compound. Using the **ATP** and **NADPH** from the light reactions, these three-carbon molecules are then **reduced** and rearranged to form a three-carbon sugar, **G3P (glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate)**. This is the stage where the chemical energy is actually stored in a stable, organic molecule. For the cycle to continue, the initial molecule, **RuBP**, must be regenerated. Most of the **G3P** molecules are used, along with more **ATP**, to reform RuBP, allowing the cycle to start again and fix more CO2. Crucially, for every six molecules of G3P produced, **one molecule of G3P** exits the cycle. Two of these G3P molecules can combine outside the cycle to form a six-carbon sugar, **glucose** (C6H12O6), which is the main product used for energy, growth, and storage (e.g., as starch) by the plant. Photosynthesis is a critical process for all ecosystems, serving as the ultimate source of organic carbon and atmospheric oxygen.`,

    content: `## Key Formulas for Kinematics

Here are the core equations we need to memorize for the exam.

### 1. Constant Velocity

The simplest case: position $$x$$ as a function of time $$t$$.

$$
x(t) = x_0 + v_x t
$$

Where $$x_0$$ is the initial position and $$v_x$$ is the constant velocity.

### 2. Constant Acceleration

These are the "big five" equations.

1. **Velocity as a function of time:**

   $$
   v(t) = v_0 + at
   $$

2. **Position as a function of time:**

   $$
   x(t) = x_0 + v_0 t + \\tfrac{1}{2} a t^2
   $$

3. **Velocity as a function of position (the "timeless" equation):**

   $$
   v^2 = v_0^2 + 2a(x - x_0)
   $$

I always forget the quadratic formula, which is often needed to solve for $$t$$ in the position equation.
For any quadratic equation $$ax^2 + bx + c = 0$$, the solution is:

$$
x = \\frac{-b \\pm \\sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a}
$$

2. **Attractive** (Craving)
3. **Easy** (Response)
4. **Satisfying** (Reward)

To break a bad habit, invert these:
1. Make it **Invisible**
2. Make it **Unattractive**
3. Make it **Difficult**
4. Make it **Unsatisfying**

    noteTagIds: ["3b6c9d1e-8f2a-4b7c-9d5e-4a3f2b1c1007"],
    content: `## Understanding Gradient Descent

This is the core optimization algorithm used in most machine learning models. The goal is to find the values for a model's parameters (weights, $$\\theta$$) that minimize a cost function (or loss function), $$J(\\theta)$$.

### The Update Rule
The algorithm works by iteratively updating the parameters in the *opposite* direction of the gradient of the cost function.

The update rule for a single parameter $$\\theta_j$$ is:

$$
\\theta_j := \\theta_j - \\alpha \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial \\theta_j} J(\\theta)
$$

Where:
- $$\\theta_j$$ is the parameter we are updating.
- $$\\alpha$$ (alpha) is the **learning rate**, which controls how big of a step we take.
- $$\\frac{\partial}{\\partial \\theta_j} J(\\theta)$$ is the partial derivative of the cost function with respect to that parameter (i.e., the gradient).

We repeat this update for all parameters $$\\theta_0, \\theta_1, ..., \\theta_n$$ simultaneously until the algorithm converges on a minimum.

**Key point:** Choosing the right learning rate $$\\alpha$$ is critical. Too small, and it's too slow. Too large, and it might overshoot the minimum or even diverge.

This is for my **Total Recall AI** project.

### 1. Install Dependencies
Need the core Drizzle package, the Postgres driver, and the pgvector type helper.
\`\`\`bash
npm install drizzle-orm postgres
npm install -D drizzle-kit
# Special package for pgvector types
npm install @neondatabase/serverless
\`\`\`
*(I'm using \`postgres\` (node-postgres) as the driver).*

### 2. Define Schema (\`schema.ts\`)
The key is importing \`vector\` from the \`@neondatabase/serverless\` package.

\`\`\`ts
import { pgTable, serial, text, timestamp } from 'drizzle-orm/pg-core';
import { vector } from '@neondatabase/serverless';

export const notesTable = pgTable('notes', {
  id: serial('id').primaryKey(),
  title: text('title').notNull(),
  content: text('content').notNull(),
  createdAt: timestamp('created_at').defaultNow(),
  
  // The magic field for pgvector!
  // Assuming 1536 dimensions for OpenAI's 'text-embedding-3-small'
  embedding: vector('embedding', { dimensions: 1536 }),
});
\`\`\`

### 3. Run Migration
\`\`\`bash
npx drizzle-kit generate:pg
# Then run the generated SQL in the DB
\`\`\`

This setup should allow Drizzle to correctly handle the \`vector\` type when I insert and query data.

### Backstory
Kaelen was born in the deep woods, part of a reclusive clan that guarded an ancient ruin. His family was betrayed and slaughtered by a mercenary group called the **Crimson Hand**, who were seeking an artifact in the ruin. Kaelen was the only survivor, hiding in the shadows and watching the massacre.

He spent the next decade on the streets of a human city, honing his skills in stealth, poison, and disguise, all while hunting down members of the Crimson Hand one by one.

### Motivations
1. **Revenge:** Find and eliminate the leader of the Crimson Hand, a man named Captain Drax.
2. **Redemption:** He feels he failed his family by hiding. He's looking for a way to "atone," even if he doesn't know what that means.
3. **Distrustful:** He is slow to trust anyone, especially mercenaries or those who seek power.

1.  **$$e$$ (Euler's Number):** The base of the natural logarithm, an irrational number approximately equal to 2.71828.
2.  **$$i$$ (The Imaginary Unit):** Defined as the square root of -1 (i.e., $$i^2 = -1$$). It's the foundation of complex numbers.
3.  **$$\\pi$$ (Pi):** The ratio of a circle's circumference to its diameter, an irrational number approximately equal to 3.14159.
4.  **$$1$$ (One):** The multiplicative identity.
5.  **$$0$$ (Zero):** The additive identity.

### The Source (Euler's Formula)
The identity is a special case of **Euler's Formula**, which states that for any real number $$x$$:

$$
e^{ix} = \\cos(x) + i \\sin(x)
$$

If we substitute $$x = \\pi$$:
- $$\\cos(\\pi) = -1$$
- $$\\sin(\\pi) = 0$$

So the formula becomes:
$$
e^{i\\pi} = -1 + i(0)
$$
$$
e^{i\\pi} = -1
$$

By simply adding 1 to both sides, we get the famous identity:
$$
e^{i\\pi} + 1 = 0
$$

It's amazing because it connects geometry ($$\\pi$$), algebra ($$i$$), and analysis ($$e$$) in one simple, profound statement.`,

    content: `## Should I move to the downtown apartment?

Trying to make a logical decision. My current lease is up in 3 months.

### Option 1: Stay in Current Apt
- **Pros:**
    - Cheaper rent ($1800/mo)
    - I know the area
    - No moving hassle
- **Cons:**
    - 45 min commute (one-way)
    - Getting small
    - Old appliances

### Option 2: Move to Downtown Apt
- **Pros:**
    - 10 min walk to work!
    - New building, great gym
    - Very spacious
    - Feels more "energizing"
- **Cons:**
    - **Much** more expensive ($2600/mo)
    - Noisy neighborhood
    - Less green space nearby

### Financial Breakdown
- Current Commute Cost: ~$50/mo (gas) + (45*2*20) = 1800 min/mo = 30 hours/mo.
- Downtown Commute Cost: $0.
- Is 30 hours of my time + $50 in gas worth the $800 rent difference?
- $800 / 30 hours = ~$26.67 per hour.
- My time is definitely worth more than that. This makes the move seem much more reasonable.`,

- **Voice Memos**:
    - Record a voice note -> Transcribe to text -> Embed the text.
    - The AI could answer questions from my spoken thoughts.
- **Image/OCR Integration**:
    - Upload a photo (e.g., a whiteboard, a page from a book).
    - Run OCR to extract text.
    - Make the text from images searchable. This would be *huge*.
- **"On This Day" Feature**:
    - Surfaces notes you wrote on this day 1, 2, 5 years ago. Good for reflection.
- **Web Clipper**:
    - A browser extension to save articles or snippets directly as a new note.
    - The AI could then "read" all my saved articles.
- **Inter-note Linking (Bi-directional)**:
    - Something like \`[[Note Title]]\` to link notes.
    - A graph view to see how ideas connect. (Maybe too much?)

    content: `## How to make gradient text in CSS

I always forget this trick. You have to make the background a gradient and then *clip* it to the text.

\`\`\`css
.gradient-text {
  /* 1. Set the background to the gradient you want */
  background: linear-gradient(
    90deg, 
    rgba(131,58,180,1) 0%, 
    rgba(253,29,29,1) 50%, 
    rgba(252,176,69,1) 100%
  );

  /* 2. Clip the background to the text */
  -webkit-background-clip: text;
  background-clip: text;

  /* 3. Make the text color transparent */
  /* This is the magic part! */
  color: transparent;

  /* Optional: Make it stand out */
  font-size: 3rem;
  font-weight: bold;
}
\`\`\`

### Example HTML
\`\`\`html
<h1 class="gradient-text">
  Hello World!
</h1>
\`\`\`
This is great for hero sections.
